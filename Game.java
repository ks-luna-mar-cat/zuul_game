/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Escape the ship" application. 
 *  "Escape the ship" is a very simple, text based adventure game. 
 *  The scenario is - The big storrm is coming, so the user should find 
 *  emergency exit within 5 minuites.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
 *
 * @author  Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes and Kate Son
 *
 * Modifications:
 * - add look and eat method
 * - add a case for the look and eat command in the processCommand method
 * - update code to show commands in the printHelp method
 * - create items and add to rooms
